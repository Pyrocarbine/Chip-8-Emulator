# Description

This Chip-8 emulator allows the user to run any chip-8 (.ch8) file. The user must have access to c++ and the SDL library installed. 

This project is developed using a guide written by [Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/). However many additional updates were implemented to fix bugs discovered in this [test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite). Last updated on September 2024.
